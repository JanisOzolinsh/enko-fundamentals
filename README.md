# gds-direct-lib

A set of reusable functions for http server setup, request/response format standartization, sql query generation, etc... that are too small for now for a dedicated lib for each of them, but still needed to avoid copying same code to multiple projects.

Basically, all the reusable code from [gdsdirectplus/gds-direct-nodejs](https://gitlab.dyninno.net/gdsdirectplus/gds-direct-nodejs) that I needed in [client-booking-page/booking-page-nodejs](https://gitlab.dyninno.net/client-booking-page/booking-page-nodejs)
